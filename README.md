Short Description

Welcome to X-Wing tournament results CLI
  This CLI is able to pull all the tournament results off of the website ListFortress.com. Once prompted, the user can then access specific tournaments by entering the corresponding list number, between 1-25. Once a tournament is selected, the user will be given a brief description of each player, where they placed in the tournament, and their total score in green. Below each player is their chosen pilots and any additional modifications on pilot's ship.

Instructions
 While in the First-Project-Scrape, enter 'ruby bin/run' into the terminal to call the CLI. You will be greeted by the CLI and provided the latest 25 tournaments around the world. Once you have gone through the listing, you may enter the corresponding number of the tournament into the terminal to dive deeper. The corresponding number will pull up the players in the tournament and provide the rank, score, and squadlist that player used in the tournament. After the player information has been provided, the CLI will exit, but if you wish to leave any point earlier, you may enter 'goodbye' so immediately exit. Enjoy!

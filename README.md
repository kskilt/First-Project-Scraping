Short Description

Welcome to X-Wing tournament results CLI
  This CLI is able to pull all the tournament results off of the website ListFortress.com. Once prompted, the user can then access specific tournaments by entering the corresponding list number. Once a tournament is selected, the user will be given a brief description of each player, where they placed in the tournament, and their total score in green. Below each player is their chosen pilots and any additional modifications on pilot's ship. The user is then asked if they would like to return to the tournament listings, or if they are content and ready to exit the program.
  I am going to put a short description here. Things I need to address/want to address
  -What is X wing
  -What is the purpose of my CLI
  -What am I showing

  -Weekly top squads
    I want to be able to type in a date and see the first squad in each event in the past 7 days limited to 10 total. Each should be accessible to a second layer giving the list of ships and tournament data.
  -Percentage of the field playing the same ships
    need to iterate over the squad lists to see the number of ships that match self compared to number of ships total. I can do a simple counter that goes up each time the selected ship matches the total ships and then divide by the total to access the percentage.
